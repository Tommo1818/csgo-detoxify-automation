## Abstract

Toxicity is the word used to describe the negative behaviour that some people exhibit when
communicating with others while online, particularly in a manner that they would not necessarily
show if communicating face-to-face [1]. In the realm of online multiplayer games, these toxic
interactions are often prevalent, and it is usually the focus of research when trying to combat it.
It can take many forms, but it mostly condenses down to any action performed in-game by a
player, with the intention of upsetting or abusing another player.

All online multiplayer games face the issue of toxicity between players in one form or another.
Competitive and esports titles allow players to compete against one another, often grouped in
teams. For these teams to be able to collaborate with each other, a greater level of
communication is needed compared to non-competitive games. This often takes the form of a
text chat, or a voice chat system to allow the teams to communicate with one another, and even
sometimes to the opposing team(s). The unfortunate truth is, when a form of communication is
granted to players, there will inevitably be bad actors that aim to abuse it. Players may get angry
or upset at themselves or others, and this can materialise into toxicity or abuse towards other
players.

This project aims to look at the usage of deep learning and natural language processing to detect
toxicity through the analysis of real game data from Valve Software’s “Counter Strike”, and to
evaluate its effectiveness and viability with feedback from real people. In the process, we look at
the methods that are currently employed in existing systems across other eSports titles, to
further assess viability. The overall objective of this paper is to contribute to the effort of tackling
toxicity in gaming, or perhaps even on the wider internet, which will hopefully create a safer
online environment in the future for all.

It was found that while the application of a deep learning model to detect toxicity in the context
of Counter Strike is feasible, careful tweaking and fine tuning is needed for high accuracy, which
is vital if harsh punishments are being administered based off these predictions.
